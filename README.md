The code you provided is using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create a loader animation. Here's a brief documentation of what each part of the code does:

### JavaScript (script.js)
1. `gsap.timeline()`: This initializes a new GSAP timeline, which is used to sequence multiple animations.

2. `tl.to("#bolt-path", {...})`: This animates the strokeDasharray of the path with the ID "bolt-path" over a duration of 1 second.

3. `tl.to("#bolt-rect", {...})`: This animates the vertical position (y) of the rectangle with the ID "bolt-rect" to 0 over a duration of 1 second.

4. `tl.to("svg", {...})`: This animates the scaling of the SVG element to 0.

5. `tl.to(".panel", {...})`: This animates the vertical position (y) of elements with the class "panel" to "-100%" over a duration of 2 seconds, with a stagger effect of 0.25 seconds between each element.

### CSS (style.css)
1. `.loader`: This class styles the loader container to be fixed in position, covering the entire viewport, and centers its contents vertically and horizontally.

2. `.loader-inner`: This class styles the inner container of the loader, setting its width to 100 pixels and maintaining an aspect ratio of 1.

3. `.loader-panel` and `.panel`: These classes style the individual panels of the loader animation, with each panel taking up an equal portion of the inner container's space and having a background color of dark gray.

4. `#bolt-rect`: This selector styles the rectangle within the SVG, initially setting its vertical position (transform: translateY) to 100%.

5. `#bolt-path`: This selector styles the bolt path within the SVG, initially setting its stroke-dashoffset and stroke-dasharray properties to create a hidden appearance.

### HTML (index.html)
This HTML file sets up the structure of the document, including the loader animation and other content.

### External Libraries
The code also includes links to external libraries such as Bootstrap and GSAP, which are used for additional styling and animation functionality.

Overall, this code creates a visually appealing loader animation using GSAP, with various elements animated sequentially to provide a smooth loading experience for users.
